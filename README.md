Hi there!

This is my first project as part of the Odin Full Stack Developer using Javascript course.

In this project, I'll be making a website containing few recipes for cooking!

I'll be implementing all the stuffs I have learnt about HTML making to make it a functional and organized website. The stuffs include making a list, adding images, hyperlinking and writing content.
